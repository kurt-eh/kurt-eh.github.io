                    <p>
                         By the year 2500, mankind has become in interplanetary species, but the issues that plague humanity continue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Humankind has split into one minor and two major factions. The two primary factions are the League of Planets, and the Planetary Union, with the Purist Nation dogging at their heels.
                    </p>
                    <img id="clipart" alt="Clipart Galaxy" src="images/galaxy.jpg" style="float:left">  
                    <p>
                         The Planetary Union is the original interplanetary government of humanity, and thus still claims Earth. It is the largest of the three nations in terms of planets, population, and navy.              
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The League of Planets was founded on a basis of science, and is run as though it were a corporation. The pursuit of science is the primary goal of the League, with the Scientific Council reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, while the head of state is the First Scientists. The league has a considerable navy, although smaller than that of the Planetary Union. The League participated in the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Galactic Wars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The Purist Nation is a fundamentalist society, based on an amalgamation of religions. Worshiping "High One," the Nation is xenophobic in the extreme, and preaches that all other species are condemned to spend eternity with the "Low One." The Nation has only one or two spaceports where trade is even allowed with other species. Nationalite children are taught nursery rhymes about the best ways to attack other species should they be encountered.

                         The Planetary Union naval vessel, PUV James Keeling, wasn't built. It was discovered.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                         And it has a deadly reputation! The Union Navy requires a 2 year tour on the Keeling, but anyone with the means to avoid serving there will do anything to avoid stepping foot on her. By <b><i>any</i></b> means necessary.

                         Better known as <a class="italics" href="https://scottsigler.com/book/thecrypt/">The Crypt</a> in the Union and across the galaxy, the vessel is infamous for having a survival rate of only 20%.

                         Co-written with other authors the Crypt was first podcast in 2008 as a series of short stories, in which Scott kills off hundreds of his Junkies (on paper, at least). The Crypt is soon to be rewritten for a print and/or e-book release.

To combat speciesism, the Creterakians looked into the past of the varies species, and discovered sports to be a way of unifying the population to work together.</p><p> Inspired by the likes of Jackie Robinson, the Creterakians investigated the sports of all the various species and discovered one sport that maximized the potential for the majority of the species to play.</p>

                         <b>The Stone Wolves:</b>  Some families are found. Cillian Carbonaro has lead a long life. He has fought in wars for two governments (one as a mole), and an organization determined to rid the presence of the alien Creterakians who now rule over much of the galaxy, including all of humanity.  Nearly forty years later and no longer part of the Guild, Carbonaro squeaks a living as a smuggler with a crew of misfits, each wanted by their own governments. When they get a job that Carbonaro can't refuse, the remains of his unit get together for one last mission to save a friend, and hopefully, the galaxy!

                              M. "Em" Savage has awoken to find herself in what can only be called a stone sarcophagus. Woken up with no memory of who she is (save for the name on her "tomb") she must free the others trapped with them, discover not only who, but where they are, and lead their way out of whatever has them trapped in the dark.   </p>
